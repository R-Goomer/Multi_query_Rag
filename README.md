# Multi Query RAG Application

## Overview

This project is a Multi Query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload multiple PDFs, select from various embedding models, and interact with the uploaded PDFs through a chat interface. 

The application utilizes a multi-query approach to enhance retrieval performance and provide more accurate responses based on the uploaded content.
